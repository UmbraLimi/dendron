## Personal

### [[Paul Kinson|people.Paul-Kinson]]

- was my first day back to the dentist since Jan 2020 or possibly late 2019
- Lisa was there (Sentimental-Lisa) helping Paul. Heather met me at the door.
- Paul was shocked that I had had a heart attack and he spoke briefly about his taking Nexxium every data for years and that hs dad died of a heart attack at 66. Seems we have a little in common
- he was worried that the jaw being fractured and healed might mean he can't get the teeth to bit properly withou a lot of griding. He was hoping that it was the lone wisdom tooth at the top that was hitting and then they would just remove it. After I told him I was on blood thinners, he said they woud refer me back to the Oral maxillofacial surgeons (Toors was one of them) that he respects to handle the clotting complications.
- Anyway, we decided to take a look and see if he could do anything to shave the bit as needed. Turns out he only tok about 0.5 mm off, but it was enough to significantly help my bite.
- We agreed I would come back for a cleaning in 2 weeks (he's only in on Tu-W-Th now) and afterwards, he would grind some more according to what I found. He didn't want to do to much as it would trigger the tooth hurting
- overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how much better my bite is with just what he'd done
- Kelly has retired (which I knew) so I got paired with a new hygienist (Steven) who Katie has?

### [[Kelly Burchall|people.Kelly-Burchall]]

- I took Colin to see Kelly as he changed his pillow at my behest 2 nights ago and was having some success but alos maybe some lingering trouble and Kelly is great for givig him feedback and help with his neck
- AFterwards, Kelly caled me over (I stayed in the car) and we chatted briefly.
- I told him trhe stretches "left the handle" for the ribs was working really well. I was able to c=breathe better. He said I sounded better than last time
- I realized that I didn't get any stretches or exercises fro the kinesiologist, ut maybe I should ask him

## Business

### [[Bits of Wisdom podcast|project.bow-podcast]]

- [[Eli|people.Eli-Finer]] and I recorded our third podcast for Bits of Wisdom Took 90 minusts or so and we winged it
- It ended up being about India nd Wuju with me throwing in a few questions and biological principals to help explain things
- Eli said he won't be keeping the India stuff, but the Wuju stuff was good
- I suggested that he mark the broad sections we are generally keeping and inside them, I will clean up my parts and he will do his
- Eli created [a bits of wisdom subdomain](https://bitsofwisdom.transistor.fm)
- Eli showed me how to edit overlapping tracks from each of us (when we are talking at the same time) as well as re-record any section we need to clarify
