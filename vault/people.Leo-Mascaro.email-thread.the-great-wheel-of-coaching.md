# [The Great Wheel of Coaching]

### Growth is a wheel on the path between who you are and who you can be. A great coach keeps the wheel turning.

Apr 22

> “You get the best effort from others not by lighting a fire beneath them, but by building a fire within.” _— Bob Nelson_

**A coach helps you see the best in yourself.**

The true path of success runs through the heart. The coach guides. The individual or team walks the path. It is a journey of discovery where potential is forged into reality.

Imagine a great wheel revolving along the path. Each revolution is an iteration, a new version of you. A coach sets the wheel in motion and keeps it turning.

**A coach starts by getting to know two people: the person you are and the person you can be.** The difference between the two is your potential. You see a small gap between the two, but a coach sees the vast distance separating them.

_The wheel turns._

**A coach then sets the stage for what CAN be.** You are shown a vision of what is possible. At first you balk at what is perceived to be impossible. Surely you are not capable of such a thing, but the vision activates your latent potential. A seed is planted.

_The wheel turns._

**A coach then tests you.** You view the test as unreasonable, but a coach knows growth is impossible without stretching the limits of what you are capable of. You go into the test knowing what to expect but not understanding.

_The wheel turns._

**A coach then nurtures you.** You often fail the test. You break down and second guess the vision. You say... “I failed.” A coach says... “You experienced. You learned. Now try again and grow.” Sometimes failure repeats, but the sting of it lessens.

_The wheel turns._

**A coach then watches you succeed.** What you once perceived as too difficult clicks into place. Knowledge becomes wisdom. An increment of potential is converted. The seed germinates. Growth is achieved.

_The wheel turns._

You are ready for the next iteration.

The cycle repeats. The wheel keeps turning. **You continue growing, converting one increment of potential at a time.**
